# BigQuery Batch Upload Strategy

## Speed Test Results (10 files)
- **Processing Rate**: 1,620 files/second
- **Records per File**: 239.2 average  
- **BigQuery Upload**: 1,076 records/second
- **Upload Time per Batch**: ~2.2 seconds for 2,392 records

## Full Dataset Projections (29,486 files)
- **Estimated Total Records**: ~7,053,051
- **Processing Time**: 0.3 minutes
- **Upload Time**: 10.5 minutes  
- **Rate Limiting Delays**: 9.4 minutes
- **Total Estimated Time**: 20.2 minutes (0.3 hours)

## Optimal Batch Strategy

### File Processing Batches
- **Batch Size**: 1,000 files per batch
- **Total Batches**: 30 batches
- **Processing per Batch**: <1 minute

### BigQuery Upload Batches  
- **Upload Batch Size**: 25,000 records
- **Total Upload Batches**: 283 batches
- **Rate Limiting**: 2-3 seconds between uploads
- **Upload Time per Batch**: ~2.2 seconds

### Memory Management
- Process 1,000 files → Transform → Upload → Clear memory
- Prevents memory overflow with large dataset
- Allows progress tracking and resume capability

### Error Handling
- Skip individual file errors without stopping
- Retry failed BigQuery uploads (3 attempts)
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting

### Final Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 1**: Process files in 1K batches locally
2. **Phase 2**: Upload in 25K record batches to BigQuery
3. **Phase 3**: Add 2-second delays between uploads
4. **Phase 4**: Progress tracking and resume capability

**Expected Total Time**: ~20-25 minutes for complete upload
