How to Make Requests
Our API offers numerous endpoints, which are explained in individual threads in this category.

Base URL: https://api.keepa.com/

API Access Key: Every request requires your API access key as a parameter. You can find and change your key here.

HTTP Method: All requests must be issued as an HTTPS GET and accept gzip encoding. If possible, use a Keep-Alive connection.

Parallel Requests: Multiple requests can be made in parallel to increase throughput.

Response Format
The response is always in JSON format. Every response will contain information about your current API access:

{
  "refillRate": Integer,
  "refillIn": Integer,
  "tokensLeft": Integer,
  "tokensConsumed": Integer,
  "tokenFlowReduction": Double,
  "error": {
    "type": String,
    "message": String,
    "details": String
  }
}
Response Fields
refillRate: Number of tokens generated by your active subscriptions.
refillIn: Time in milliseconds until your token bucket will be refilled (happens every minute).
tokensLeft: How many tokens you currently have left. This value can be negative, as requests are always executed as long as there is a positive token balance when the request is submitted.
tokensConsumed: Number of tokens this request consumed.
tokenFlowReduction: Tracking products through the API reduces your actual token refill rate by this value (rounded to an integer).
error: Contains error information. Only set if an error occurred. An error does not mean the whole request failed (e.g., batch requests).
Note: You can use this information to plan your requests. Unused tokens will expire after 60 minutes.

Possible HTTP Status Codes
200 - OK: The request was successfully executed.
400 - Bad Request: The request was malformed or could not be successfully executed.
402 - Payment Required: The used API key does not grant access.
405 - Method Not Allowed: A request parameter is out of the allowed range.
429 - Too Many Requests: You are out of tokens.
500 - Internal Server Error: An unexpected error occurred when executing this request.
Note: For any status code other than 200, you will still receive the token bucket information in the error stream. The remainder of the response varies and is explained in the individual threads.

Amazon only provides the data in bracketed ranges such as “10+” or “100+”, rather than as exact figures. Undefined if it has no value. Most ASINs do not have this value set. The value is variation specific.

}
offers
Optional field, set only if the offers parameter was used in the Product Request. Contains Marketplace Offer Objects.

liveOffersOrder
Optional field, set only if the offers parameter was used in the Product Request. Contains an ordered array of index positions in the offers array for all Marketplace Offer Objects retrieved for this call. If no offers were found, the field will be null. The sequence of integers reflects the ordering of the offers on the Amazon offer page (for all conditions). Since the offers field contains historical offers as well as current offers, one can use this array to look up all offers that are currently listed on Amazon in the correct order. Note: If there are identical offers (same seller, same condition, same shipping type, and same condition text) we only track the lowest-priced one. If this happens, there will be duplicate offer indexes in the liveOffersOrder field at the position of the omitted duplicate (higher-priced) offer - all pointing to the lowest-priced offer’s index.
Example: [ 3, 5, 2, 18, 15 ] - The offer with the array index 3 of the offers field is currently the first one listed on the offer listings page on Amazon, followed by the offer with the index 5, and so on.
Example with duplicates: [ 3, 5, 2, 18, 5 ] - The second offer, as listed on Amazon, is a lower-priced duplicate of the 5th offer on Amazon. The lower-priced one is included in the offers field at index 5.

buyBoxSellerIdHistory
Optional field, set only if the offers or buybox parameter was used in the Product Request.
Contains a history of sellerIds that held the Buy Box in the format: Keepa time minutes, sellerId, […].
If no seller qualified for the Buy Box, the sellerId “-1” is used (suppressed Buy Box). If we were unable to identify the seller or if the product was out of stock (no seller), the sellerId is “-2”.
Example: [“2860926”, “ATVPDKIKX0DER”, …]

buyBoxUsedHistory
Optional field, set only if the offers or buybox parameter was used in the Product Request.
A history of used buy box winners, containing the sellerIds, offer sub-condition, and FBA status in the format: Keepa time minutes, seller id, condition, isFBA, […].

condition can have the following values:
“2” - Used - Like New, “3” - Used - Very Good, “4” - Used - Good, “5” - Used - Acceptable
isFBA is either “1” - offer is FBA or “0” - offer is merchant fulfilled.

Boolean indicating if the product’s Buy Box is available for subscribe and save.

offersSuccessful
Valid only if the offers parameter was used in the Product Request. Boolean indicating if the system was able to retrieve fresh offer information. Retrieval of fresh offers will always fail if the product has no offers (compare COUNT_* csv entries).

As updates to those fields are infrequent, it is essential to know when our system updated them. The absolute value indicates the number of offers fetched at the given time. If the value is positive, it means all available offers were fetched. If negative, there were more offers than fetched.
16 - RATING: The product’s rating history (an integer from 0 to 50, e.g., 45 = 4.5 stars)

32 - BUY_BOX_USED_SHIPPING: The Used buy box price history (any sub-condition), including shipping costs. If no offer qualified for the used buy box, the price has the value -1
33 - PRIME_EXCL: Price history of the lowest Prime exclusive New offer
The second dimension contains the price/value history in the format Keepa time minutes, value, […] or, if the type includes *_SHIPPING costs, the format: Keepa time minutes, price, shipping costs, […]. If history is unavailable, it is null. The price is an integer of the respective Amazon locale’s smallest currency unit (e.g., euro cents or yen). If no offer was available in the given interval (e.g., out of stock), the price has the value -1.

Important csv information:

We only append a new entry to the history array if the price/value changed, not every time we update the product.
Shipping and Handling costs are not included unless specified.
Amazon is considered to be part of the marketplace. If Amazon has the overall lowest new price, the marketplace new price in the corresponding time interval is identical to the Amazon price.
The following types are only set if the offers parameter was used in the Product Request: NEW_FBM_SHIPPING, WAREHOUSE, NEW_FBA, RATING, COUNT_REVIEWS, BUY_BOX_SHIPPING, USED_*_SHIPPING, COLLECTIBLE_*_SHIPPING, REFURBISHED_SHIPPING, BUY_BOX_USED_SHIPPING, and PRIME_EXCL
About Lightning deals: If a deal is currently active, the last entry of the history array will contain the end date (a future date) with a price of -1. When accessing the current deal price, handle this special case. Alternatively, use the current price array of the stats object to access the current price. If no deal is currently active but the last entry has the value -1 with a date in the future, it means an upcoming deal is announced (scheduled to start at that date).
About eBay prices: eBay listings often have incorrect information and/or product codes, causing item mismatches and incorrect pricing information. Use eBay price history information with caution and do not rely on their accuracy. We update eBay prices at different intervals than Amazon prices.
We can add new data types to the csv field from time to time without announcement. Do not expect a fixed size of the first array dimension in your implementation.
